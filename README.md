# CSCI488_doctor_appointment
For this project we were Working with a project design emphasis, a doctor and patient appointment website was created. For this project we used visual studio as our IDE. The doctor and patient appointment had slightly different functions/roles. Each patient and each doctor had their own account. This site helped doctor and patient communication enabling them to send messages, create appointment and keep notes. The patient was able to send a message to their doctor and keep that message saved similar to an inbox, additionally the patient could make an appointment and that date would be saved and the patient could make make changes like deleting the appointment and so on with some other functions and doctors having a lightly more functional account.
